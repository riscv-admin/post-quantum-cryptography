Meeting minutes are captured (but not saved) on RISC-V recommended etherpad: https://tech.riscv.org/etherpad/p/crypto


# Misc

- Richard and Nicolas will participate in RSA's conference panel  :Progress in Standardizing Cryptography Extensions for RISC-V Processors

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Crypto community is still evaluating https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555.pdf
    - no claim to break Kyber or Dilithium (yet ?)
    - could delay standardization process (expected this summer)
    - update to the paper is expected soon (no idea on the content yet)
    - no pragmatic application yet
- Everyone agrees on utility of Keccak acceleration for RVV

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- Discussion on how to identify a "process" (to uniquely identity key handle user)
   - Satp, ASID, PMPs, SSqosid
   - Satp only might be enough
- Mechanism will need to support instance migration (without compromising the keys) and key vanishing
   - unwrapping the key again needs to be supported
- The number of Key handles will be limited (in hardware) and application may fail to get a key handle
- Key handle are created from key shares (masked keys)
- This instruction should be able to fail when no handles are available


# fast track extensions

- Nothing new to report this week (still need to experiment with small CLM area evaluation)
