# Misc

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- discussion on-going on specification with accordion mode (supporting non power of 2 lengths) (https://csrc.nist.gov/Events/2024/accordion-cipher-mode-workshop-2024)
- GHASH is not collision resistant / nor pre-image resistant so is not used in signature scheme 

- Plan: propose Keccak acceleration as main PQC proposal (would be useful beyond PQC)
- might be supported as its own extension, some uarch specificities may need to be solved first

- still working on optimized NTT version to measure perf and evaluate improvements

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- No progress
- Barry working on reference design spec, should be ready to share a first version around May 9th
- Need feedback from O/S experts at RVIA for VM / process distinction
- Linux kernel maps the kernel memory in the user spaces but with a different page attributes making it only accessible in system mode (this allows fast acceleration of sys call)

# fast track extensions

- nothing to report this week
