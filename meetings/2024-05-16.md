# Misc

- Discussion around usefulness of quantum key distribution QKD (requirements for heavy cost hardware [satellite or physical land line], no RISC-V application foreseen)

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- NIST news:
    - No plan change regarding summer standardization
    - round 4: non-lattice based KEM
- Adoption of composite certificate system in TLS (turning several signatures into a single signature)
      - hybrid certificate system discouraged by NSA (but required by European agency)
- CNSA has no plan to support Sphinx+ for secure boot
- Markku had some discussion with chinese vendors to understand their requirements for PQC (that differ from NIST standards)

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- no progress

# fast track extensions

- resume experimentation on area cost of supporting smaller size vclmul[h]
- could offer a 8 and 16-bit extension to Zvbc32e
