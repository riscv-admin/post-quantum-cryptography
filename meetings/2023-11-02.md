## Misc:
- Specific meeting scheduled Nov 2nd to discuss High-Assurance crypto
- Task group will have an informal meeting at the RISC-V summit in the morning of the member day (Nov 6th 2023, Room 202 11am-noon)
- Ken and Markku will present Wednesday during the main summit agenda
- Markku slides’ https://mjos.fi/doc/20231108-rvsummit-pqc.pdf
- Meeting time will change with RVIA on-going meeting slot shuffling
   - Should be discussed with Security HC to ensure max attendance

## Vector Crypto Fast Track

- Not much to report, Nicolas' slide are waiting internal validation and should be presented at the RISC-V Summit on Nov 6th

## Post-quantum Cryptography:
- Markku was presenting  at ICCC
  - In a panel discussion: https://iccconference.org/?session=panel-discussion-evolution-of-the-cryptographic-standards-ecosystem-m22b
  - POST-QUANTUM VS. AVA_VAN (M23A): https://iccconference.org/?session=post-quantum-vs-ava_van-m23a (slides: https://mjos.fi/doc/20231101-iccc-pq_ava_van.pdf)
- Reviewing some results of vectorized BoringSSL Dilithium benchmark 
  - Note that auto-vectorized compiled code may not exploit the base vector + vector crypto instructions optimally (since it used as baseline for PQC suggestions we need to be careful when drawing conclusion, manual optimization may give different results) 
  - Vmulq (modulo q) proposal (Markku’s slide)
  - Vmaccq put aside because code seems to mostly accumulate with zero
  - Dilithium has implementations highly optimized for AVX2 (it was partially conceived to be efficient on such architectures) which makes it a good candidate for efficient implementation on RVV
Given the care that went into those implementations, it will take time to get RVV implementations (with or without the new instructions under consideration) to the same level of optimization


## High-Assurance:

- GCM is one of the topic for the TG: need to have AES-GCM implementation with side channel resistance
- Specific meeting setup by Richard Nov 2nd afternoon to make progress
