# Misc

- [carry-over] New issue raised on the github
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/383
    - Should we keep not working code ?
    - Need write permissions to integrated suggested fixes
- Cleaning ratified vector crypto
    - Still need to setup a meeting between Richard/Jeff/Ken/Rivos (Barna who follows this work) to track/plan final tasks
    - Richard reached out, waiting for agreement on meeting time [Updated Feb 15th]
- [carry-over] Discussion on a few issues raised on vector cryptography spec:
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/381
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/380 `vfslide1(up/down).vf`
        - Does not need to be constant time and is floating-point specific
        - Follow-up discussion done on the issue ticket
        - Need to converge on response+change
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/379 
        - Typo fixed by opened PR https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/382
- Using etherpad (RVIA recommended method) to capture meeting minutes: https://tech.riscv.org/etherpad/p/crypto
- Goal would be to archive the riscv-crypto repository (development finished)
    - still used for vector crypto fast track development
    - Repo/Specification status would need to be clarified on Readme.md
    - Eventually scalar and vector crypto specs will need to be integrated into unpriv ISA spec 
- Discussing about participation to RSA panel on RISC-V + cryptography
     - Richard will be participating to the RSA conference
     - Markky going to HOST 2024 conference (tutorial) and Real World Crypto

Next meeting February 22nd 2024

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

PQC specification repository: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pqc

- No new things to report this week (working on the implementation a bit)
- Should start on the doc pretty soon

# High Assurance Cryptography 

High Assurance Cryptography specification repository: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-hac

- Some updates on the Wrap-V diagram (including some mistake pointed out by Barry on key #2 and SIV)
- Encouraging everyone to comment on what should be integrated into AEAD (additional data) (see Richard's list in slide: https://github.com/riscv-admin/post-quantum-cryptography/files/14225544/Wrap-V.HAC-TG.update.20240208.pdf) [Spec will list required/reserved/optional fields]
- Next step: defining actual instructions (both for key wrapping and full round AES)
     - will start from original full-round instruction (but will need change to incorporate key handle/wrapper)

# fast track extensions

Tracking: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/362

- Nothing new to report
- Draft v0.0.4 still needs to be shared with the tech-crypto-ext mailing list
- Goal is to share the new spec draft with a broader RVIA audience by the end of February 2024
