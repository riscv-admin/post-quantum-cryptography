- PQC Readiness -> PQC Transition
- Message authentication: since HMAC is tricky to build securely, the TG could recommend to KMAC (Keccak equivalent) in addition to HMAC
- Should RSA be removed (seems difficult as it is still heavily used and required for interoperability)
- BSI recommendation: https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.html
- Russian Ghost -> GOST
- Need to mention geo specific algorithms (in particular if they are not supported by RISC-V)


# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Accepted paper at ACM / CCM conference: RISC-V vector CPU with crypto extensions (including Keccak instruction)

# High Assurance Cryptography 

Richar's slides: [Richard Newell Slides - HAC Use.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16898944/Richard.Newell.Slides.-.HAC.Use.pptx)

- Discussing HA crypto services
- Should new memory encryption algorithm be considered ?

# fast track extensions

- No news, still waiting for ARC feedback
