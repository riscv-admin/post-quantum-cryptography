# Misc

- Cleaning ratified vector crypto
    - Need to setup a meeting between Richard/Jeff/Ken/Rivos (Barna who follows this work) to track/plan final tasks
    - Some dependencies may remain (e.g. unified discovery)
    - SAIL and ACT (pull requests in flight)
- Ken sees existing OpenSSL optimization opportunities (part of his summit talk)
    - Next step is to list them down and see what resources could be used to perform them

Next meeting will be January 25th 2024 at 10am (Pacific).

# Post-Quantum Cryptography


- Keccak multi-round instruction prototyped in spike (https://github.com/nibrunieAtSi5/riscv-isa-sim/pull/2) to be used to get updated instruction counts
- Markku got a talk accepted

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- Presentation by Richard of the SIV mechanism for Wrap-V (Synthetic Initialization Vector) 
    - SIV mode makes encryption deterministic (avoid Nonce miss-use)
- Presentation by Richard of Wrap-V Authenticated Additional Data

# Vector Fast Track 

- Work can be tracked on pull request: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/362
- Clean up specification draft (inc. reported typos)
- Next step: continue spec cleaning, goal is to submit for group review e/o January 2024
- Next step: spike prototyping
