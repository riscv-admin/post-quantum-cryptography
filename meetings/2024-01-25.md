Minutes of RISC-V crypto task group(s) meeting of January 25th 2024


# Presents

Al Martin (Akeana),
Andrey Matyukov (Syntacore)
Barry Spinney (Individual),
G. Richard Newell (Microchip Technology),
Luis Fiolhais (SemiDynamics),
Markku-Juhani Saarinen (Tampere),
Nicolas Brunie (SiFive),


# Misc

- Cleaning ratified vector crypto
    - Still need to setup a meeting between Richard/Jeff/Ken/Rivos (Barna who follows this work) to track/plan final tasks
- Discussion on a few issues raised on vector cryptography spec:
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/381
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/380 `vfslide1(up/down).vf`
        - Does not need to be constant time and is floating-point specific
        - Follow-up discussion required on the ticket
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/379 
        - Typo fixed by opened PR https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/382


Upcoming events:

- Suggestion for RISC-V discussion at RSA conference in Cryptographer track
- https://www.etsi.org/events/2284-10th-etsi-iqc-quantum-safe-cryptography-event
- https://rwc.iacr.org/2024/


Next meeting will be February 1st 2024.

# Post-Quantum Cryptography


- Nothing new to report on specification itself
- SLH-DSA deadline: would greatly benefit from Keccak multi-round instructions
    - Some bottlenecks like 22B values when SHA-2 is used, difficult to vectorize
    - 22B mis-alignment propagates to all subsequent blocks
    - Next step: start drafting a specification document
- Draft standard were published in August 2023, deadline for public comments was Nov 2023 so actual standard should coming Spring 2024
- Talk accepted to Real World Crypto in Toronto

# High Assurance Cryptography 


- All-round AES: Barry is working on hardware proof of concept
    - AES-SIV 
    - Suggestion so use AES-GMAC for SIV
    - Working on design as generic as possible
    - May benefit from discussion with Markkuâ€™s research teammate (Tom) working on core (CVA6) integration
    - Key schedule and inverse key schedule support with DPA protections


# Vector Fast Track 

- Nothing new to report this week
- Work can be tracked on pull request: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/362
- Next step: continue spec cleaning, goal is to submit for group review e/o January 2024
- Next step: spike prototyping
