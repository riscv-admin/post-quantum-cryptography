Minutes of RISC-V crypto task group(s) meeting of February 1st 2024


# Presents

Al Martin (Akeana),
Barry Spinney (Individual),
G. Richard Newell (Microchip Technology),
David Kravitz (SiFive)
Luis Fiolhais (SemiDynamics),
Markku-Juhani Saarinen (Tampere),
Nicolas Brunie (SiFive),
Tolga Yalcin (Qualcomm)


# Misc

- [vector-crypto] New issue raised on the github:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/383
  - Should we keep not working code in the repo ?
  - Someone with write permissions is to integrated suggested fixes

- [carry-over] Cleaning ratified vector crypto
    - Still need to setup a meeting between Richard/Jeff/Ken/Rivos (Barna who follows this work) to track/plan final tasks

- [carry-over] Discussion on a few issues raised on vector cryptography spec:
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/381
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/380 `vfslide1(up/down).vf`
        - Does not need to be constant time and is floating-point specific
        - Follow-up discussion required on the ticket
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/379 
        - Typo fixed by opened PR https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/382

- Need to ask for 2 new spec repos, one for high assurance, one for PQC
    - Action taken by Nicolas

Next meeting February 8th 2024

# Post-Quantum Cryptography


- New virtual multi-round Keccak instruction accelerates PQC algorithms
    - Halves the instruction count for PQC
- Still needs to integrate NTT instructions
- Working on hardware proof of concept
    - Progressing on general vector unit and element group support
    - Basic vector crypto support
    - PQC instructions 
- Early results would be presented to Real World Crypto
- NTT implementation with new instructions would require assembly programming
    - A bit more software development than Keccak instructions
    - May have interaction with cache hierarchy although NTT variable set is small enough (~4000 / 8000 bits) that it can almost fit into caches

# High Assurance Cryptography 
- Slides Presented by Richard: [Wrap-V HAC-TG update 20240201.pdf](https://github.com/riscv-admin/post-quantum-cryptography/files/14142959/Wrap-V.HAC-TG.update.20240201.pdf)
    - Need a Nonce (96-bit here) to ensure SIV (synthetic Initialization Vector) robustness [sentence to be reviewed by Markku / Richard]



# Vector Fast Track 

- New Fast track draft under preparation (v.0.0.3) to be shared with the group for internal review during February 2024
- Work can be tracked on pull request: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/362
- Spike prototyping started
    - Next: to be tested
