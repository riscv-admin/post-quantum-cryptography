# Misc

- No specific event organized at RISC-V Europe summit

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- No huge update
- NIST announced a Change related to secret key encoding (no impact for TG): https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/5CT4NC_6zRI/m/70E-NQXoCAAJ
   - Kyber/Dilithium: very fast key generation from seed
   - seed used as key encoding

# High Assurance Cryptography

- key shares should be stored in the HAC (only accessible to user, not to OS)
- we may want to share the key shares accross multiple harts (which would prevent us from using CSR storage which is private to a hart)
- how are key shares packed in a vector register (group) ? (e.g. for LOADKDK)

- 3 shares are needed for AES security, but 2 suffice for GHASH (linear operation)
   





# fast track extensions

- TODO: submit draft to ARC
