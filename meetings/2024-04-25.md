# Misc

- Richard, Andrew, Graeme, Nicolas working on panel preparation for RSA conference (May 8th)
- RVIA is preparing new disclosure video
- Greg Favor and Philipp Tomsich taking over Mark Himelstein (departing RVIA CTO) role in the chair meeting, RVIA looking for a VP of Technology

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Markku not available this week

# High Assurance Cryptography

- How to prevent key miss-use
- Loading wrapped key in the HAC module would provide a handle to use the key in HAC operations
- the key would be stored unencrypted as multiple shares (3 in the reference design) in the key cache
- Some miss-use prevention could be provided by having a large (random) number as the handle, but we may want to limit the handle size (1-100 keys would be supported)
- Cache size and operation (eviction / reloading) will be up to the software
- Operation with the key might fail and we need a mechanism to notify software so that key can be reloaded
- No user level way to setup an exception handler to handle 

- Needs to define key initial enrollment, re-enrollment if evicted

- Should key handles be vector or scalar ?
- For AES we might want to enroll both forward and reverse keys (for decryption)
   - Do we want both keys store in the same entry ? in different entries ?
  - Should the operation that evaluates the backward key stores it into a new entry and return a new handle ?

# Fast track 

- No progress to report, stil need to evaluate multi-width CLM
