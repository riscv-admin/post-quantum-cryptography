# Misc

Happy New Year ! 

* [carry over] Some clean-up is still required for vector crypto (listed in the vector crypto ratification plan spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Trwd7mr91iKlOi7cVlmJaoulw1ZGAAYR8ER7-pRufyI/edit?usp=sharing).
* In 2024, Task Group(s) meetings will be held Thursday 10am Pacific (next meeting Jan 11th)


# High Assurance Cryptography 

- Continuing concept study and requirements before actually suggesting new instructions (some of which should be very close to what was discussed a few years ago as part of all-round cryptography effort).
- Suggestion to study possibility of specifying internal key generation mechanisms (not just key wrapping / unwrapping / using).

# Post-Quantum Cryptography 

(Slides by Markku)

- At least thousands cycle on software, but very easy in hardware
- 200-Byte state, useful to have contiguously accessible for XOF and HASH input and output
- State storage in vector registers could be split between accessible (used in absorption and squeezing) and inaccessible parts 
- Dilithium latency is affected by XOF output capabilities of Keccak

- Proposition of vkeccakp.vi (immediate number of rounds)
    - Require VLEN >= 256
    - EEW=64, EGS=32, EGW=2048, => constraint LMUL=EGW/VLEN
    - Integrating round number in instructions allows to save looping code
    - Require full state manipulation (reading/writing/computation)
    - Work in Progress / TODO: integrating vkeccakp.vi in spike for simulation


# Vector Fast Track 

Nothing to report.
