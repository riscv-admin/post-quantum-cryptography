- running benchmarks on Banana Pi  BPI F3 RVV board with VLEN=256 
     - Keccak exploit super scalar core (#cycle < #instret) [unrolled single round]
     - very nice speedup with hand optimized NTT (20x speedup on NTT code, 40% overall) [LMUL between 1 and 2]
     - the full 256 16-bit element fits in the VRF (using 16 of the VLEN=256-bit vector registers)
     - those benchmarks make Markku questions the use for NTT specific instructions (Keccak + RVV vectorization of NTT provide very good result)
      - benchmarked done on Kyber, plan to do the same on Dilithium for completness
      - even without Keccak instruction, RVV is provided a very nice speed-up

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- Barry is prototyping a weak RNG based on ASCON (in HDL)

# fast track extensions

- no progress to report this week
