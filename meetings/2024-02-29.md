# High Assurance Cryptography 

Barry's presentation "Three Share Demo program": 9 pages of a 20-page (intended) document covering the 3-share demo program, wrap-V. Discussion on the required quality for randomness. (random throughput requirement is about 128 bits every few tens of cycle).
- Need to formalize need for a good source of entropy / randomness (similar to Zkr but maybe with a difference interface)
- Interaction between Zkr and High assurance cryptography
     - Risk for someone to take over Zkr CSR and corrupt random source
- Various version of masking (key and/or data)
- Need to draw line between HSM and ISA
- differentiation or unification of Key types (distinguish use case for AES: KDF, data encryption / decryption)
- should handle blob be interpretable by SW or should it be left to the black box unit ?
- key blob may exceed 512-bit wide (the 96-bit nonce size is putting some pressure on the size requirement)
- keys for larger algorithm (Kyber / Dilithium / RSA / ECC ...) will not fit into this blob width. The key may be split out of the handle in those cases.

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Markky working on optimized software implementation for NTT, noticing some strange behaviour for vector code generated by top-of-master (clang), might be VLA/VLS related (code path to optimized for specific VLEN values).

# fast track extensions

Out of time (will be covered next week)
