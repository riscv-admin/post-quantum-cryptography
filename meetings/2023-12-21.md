# Presents

Allen Baum (Esperanto),

G. Richard Newell (Microchip Technology),
Luis Fiolhais (SemiDynamics),
Markku-Juhani Saarinen (Tampere),
Nicolas Brunie (SiFive),
Victor Lu (Individual),


# Misc

- [carry over] Some clean-up is still required for vector crypto (listed in the vector crypto ratification plan spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Trwd7mr91iKlOi7cVlmJaoulw1ZGAAYR8ER7-pRufyI/edit?usp=sharing).
- Next meeting will be <TBD>. The last meeting of 2023, Dec 28th, is canceled.
- New meeting times (no change from Dec 14th)
     - RVIA rationalizing meetings time to minimize conflicts
     - Richard tried to have a slot in the Security block (seems difficult)
     - Reached out to Unpriv (which holds the current time slot used by the crypto TGs): waiting for unpriv chair feedback


# High Assurance

- Introduction of Wrap-V (key encryption format)
- Wrap-V is intended to support AES first but may be extended to other primitives (does it need to support arithmetic masking ?)
- Non-masking techniques exist for other algorithms (depending on their property, e.g. leveraging algebraic properties of some algorithms)

Get Mask / Re Mask names should prevent people from using it for secret generation (the random is not expected to have sufficient quality for this use case)

# Post Quantum Cryptography

- Markku working on proof of concept for Post-Quantum Cryptography (in particular FIPS-205 SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+)
- Planning discussion on Jan 4th around proposal for Keccak instructions


# Vector crypto fast track

- Fast track plan has been presented to the Tech chairs (Dec 20th 2023) and approved
    - Targeting freeze Q2’2024, ratification Q4’2024
    - Some assumptions were made with respect to the availability of SAIL implementation and ACTs for vector crypto.
