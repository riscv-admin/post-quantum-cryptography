# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Markku will present a "work in progress" and a call for action to RWC (Real Word Crypto)
- Current shape of Keccak instructions (very large state) may need to present this to the community / tech chairs and gather some feedback
- Could reuse matrix extensions IME / AME specification to integrate / manipulate large state inside / outisde of the vector registers
- Could use static registers to facilitate renaming for OoO uarchs
- Markku will present his slide for RWC next week (March 21st)
- Google's view on PQC https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- Barry work document waiting for Richard's feedback
- NIST Accordion mode: https://csrc.nist.gov/Events/2024/accordion-cipher-mode-workshop-2024
     - new variable input size cipher/AES mode
- Open Source synthesis flow: https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex/blob/master/syn/README.md

# fast track extensions

- v0.0.5 shared more broadly with RVIA https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-crypto-ext/message/961 as part of the internal review
- Integrated some synthesis results for multiple size of elements in vector carry-less multiply
