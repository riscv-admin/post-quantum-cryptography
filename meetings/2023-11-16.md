## Misc

- where to find ratified specifications
  - ratified for a long time: https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/
  - recently ratified: https://wiki.riscv.org/display/HOME/Recently+Ratified+Extensions

- Presentation by Markku of his talk proposal to Real World Crypto (RWC 2024)
  - including description of Proof-of-Concept project to do a T/O with high assurance and PQC crypto support (SoC Hub , in Tampere university, Finland)
- Discussion around secure implementations of AES
  - example of OpenTitan AES core: https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/blob/master/hw/ip/aes/rtl/aes_core.sv
 
  
## Vector crypto fast track 

Update on fast track (extra vector crypto extensions)

- Submitted to the ARC, requesting approval to start the actual fast-track process (https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-arch-review/message/185)

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Discussion on the vector multiply modulo operation
  - Potentially difficult to fit in a standard arithmetic pipeline (MAC/Multiply followed by remainder)
  - Need to evaluate hardware impact
  - Specification (WiP): Static modulo, needs to be constant time
  - Constant-time constraint makes it unsuitable to be cracked into a multiply + remainder operation (the latter not generally exposing data independent latency)
  - Proof of concept will be interesting (and hardware feasibility is a must for the spec ratification)
  - Something similar was done for scalar crypto: "View of The design of scalar AES Instruction Set Extensions for RISC-V" (https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/8729/8329)
