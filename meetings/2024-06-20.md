# Misc

- NCIC: ambivalent stance on hybrid (pre and post QC): UK wants PQC only (pre only allowed during transition)
- vector crypto: Ved starting a discussion on vstart / vl constraint and exception behavior https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/390
- no Open Source implementation of vector crypto available, Markku's university might offer one soon
- RISC-V North America summit Call For Paper: deadline for submission is July 12th
- Need to schedule a discussion about TGs presentation at the summit

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Kyber NTT twice as fast on RVV 1.0 hardware (T-Head C908) 
- NIST PQC specification expected soon (ETA: end of July 2024)
    - updating PQC on CAVP test server (including adding Sphincs+)
- University implementation will allow more accurate performance measurements    

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- Barry's looking at optimizing the GHASH implementation for the HCA PoC (e.g. Karatsuba for the carryless multiplier)
   - Discussion on the compromise between the level of recursion, the code complexity and PPA

# fast track extensions

- v0.0.6 specification version added to the PR (change: overlap between operand in Zvkgs)
