# Misc

- [carry over] Some clean-up is still required for vector crypto (listed in the vector crypto ratification plan spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Trwd7mr91iKlOi7cVlmJaoulw1ZGAAYR8ER7-pRufyI/edit?usp=sharing).
- Next meeting is Dec 21st. The last meeting of the year, Dec 28th, is canceled.
- New meeting times
     - RVIA rationalizing meetings time to minimize conflicts
     - Richard tried to have a slot in the Security block (seems difficult)
     - Reached out to Unpriv (which holds the current time slot used by the crypto TGs): waiting for unpriv chair feedback


# High Assurance

Task Group approved with Richard Newell as chair and Markku-Juhani Saarinen as vice-chair.

Discussion on the need of masking and how to implement such masking for the GHASH multiplication (shares handling across the multiplication).


# Post Quantum Cryptography

Planning technical discussion on Jan 4th around Keccak (Markku will present something).

What is the Keccak instruction expected Speed ?
- Expect to be able to do two rounds of Keccak during a single clock cycle of a modern CPU; To be tested (22nm, Tampere)
- Is this possible for General Purpose CPU in state of the art tech nodes ?
- Compromise between pipeline for highest frequency versus fusing instructions for lowest frequency
- Should we mention that the Keccak multi-round instruction is intended to be implemented with an accelerator-like unit ?
- This is new for RISC-V / RVV, so may require extensive discussions and iterations with AR.
- Markku will be able to show the expected speed-up for the multi-round solutions and its benefits versus other solutions.
   - Single-round instruction speed-up is limited
   - Cracked round instruction speed-up is very limited
- Can the “accelerator” concept be extended to the NTT concept ?
- Marrku’s RISC-V Summit talk presented the importance of accelerating Keccak (given its part in the overall Kyber or Dilithium algorithms).

Keccak and PQC acceleration Use case(s):
- Not useful for processors implementing hardware accelerators
- Some Cloud providers still rely on CPU for part of the crypto
- Expected that PQC will be slow on servers with standard instructions and will need dedicated ISA support to be competitive.


# Vector crypto fast track

- Fast track has been approved. Next step is a presentation to the Tech Chair meeting to get plan reviewed and approved (was targeting Dec 13th meeting, rescheduled for Dec 20th). Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10waKUCnSz2lrom8_DoEaXQsZmecBrE0ffj_7ikeLKxs/edit?usp=sharing
- The plan relies on ACT for vector crypto pull request https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test/pull/333
- Discussing possibility of integrating 8  / 16 bit carry-less multiply multiplication in the fast track
    - Hardware cost
    - Use cases / Rationale
