Meeting minutes are captured (but not saved) on RISC-V recommended etherpad: https://tech.riscv.org/etherpad/p/crypto

# Misc

- Markku published a short paper on his open source implementation of vector crypto, Marian, based on Pulp ARA https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1449 (implementation https://github.com/soc-hub-fi/Marian)
- discussion on VRF organization: ARA organizes the vector registers in lanes (64-bit wide), which is not necessarily compatible with vector crypto element groups [this required an operand collector in Marian]
- this issue will arise for the Keccak implementation has well
- micro-architectures (such as Vitruvius https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3575861) are often using block RAM for the VRF. it is important to have identical lanes such that the synthesis tool can reuse them (copy/stamp rather than synthesize multiple times the same block)

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Keccak instruction as currently intended will need long operand collection (gathering 1600-bit input state) and result write (writing back 1600-bit result in registers)
- Marrku will have slides to present next week

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- Richard N. could not attend this week so this topic was not covered.

# fast track extensions

- got feedback from ARC: not technical concern but request to make justification explicit to avoid lengthy discussion during public review
- Nicolas will work on integrating feedback and submit a new version
