# Misc

- Next meeting April 11th 2024

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- NIST making progress on standards: discussion on sign performance for large message/image (HSM are not suited to process large input): discussion around splitting hash and signature (signing the hash rather the message)
- NIST expect to publish new iteration by June
- some adjustments of key and signature sizes might be expected

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- cost of using AES module during key wrapping / unwrapping
- will be particularly visible when starting or when switching keys
- Could use a second AES engine, does it need to be side-channel resistant as well
- Barry and Richard will discuss some more

# fast track extensions

- No news to share this week
