# Misc

- RVIA has integrated scalar and vector crypto specification into the main RISC-V unpriviledged ISA manual (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/main/src/scalar-crypto.adoc and https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/main/src/vector-crypto.adoc). 
- riscv-crypto github repository is going to be archived soon
- Richard will attend the RSA conference this year
- Markku will attend the HOST conference this year (Hardware Oriented Security and Trust)


# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Markku presented at Real World Crypto

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- recent discussion seems to indicate numerous changes to the proof-of-concept will be required
- Markku and Richard needs to discuss the impact

# Fast track extensions: additional vector crypto instructions

- pull request has been transitioned to riscv-isa-manual repository:  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/pull/1306
