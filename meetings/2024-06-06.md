# Misc
# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- continuing work on lab prototype with vector crypto
- paper accepted to Crypto conference (hash acceleration)

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- no progress to report this week
- next step is to prototype sequence of vector instruction sequence to implement HAC-based AES-GCM
- Barry's progress:
   - implementing Sugawara's paper: "3-Share Threshold Implementation of AES S-box without Fresh Randomness" (https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/7336)
       verilog designed paper + Canright compact SBOX
   - IT issues 
   - Link to Barry's spec: [design_spec_22.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15665952/design_spec_22.pdf)
   - The Sugawara actually uses 9 values at every stage for each byte of processing (even if this is defined as a 3-share method)
   - Distinction between good and less good random number required during the processing (not everything requires high quality random)

# fast track extensions

- no progress, still TODO: submit draft to ARC
