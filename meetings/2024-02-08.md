# Misc

- New specification github repos created
    - For PQC task group: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pqc
    - For High Assurance Cryptography task group: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-hac
- [carry-over] New issue raised on the github
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/383
    - Should we keep not working code ?
    - Need write permissions to integrated suggested fixes

- [carry-over] Cleaning ratified vector crypto
    - Still need to setup a meeting between Richard/Jeff/Ken/Rivos (Barna who follows this work) to track/plan final tasks

- [carry-over] Discussion on a few issues raised on vector cryptography spec:
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/381
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/380 `vfslide1(up/down).vf`
        - Does not need to be constant time and is floating-point specific
    - https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/379 
        - Typo fixed by opened PR https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/382


**Next meeting**: February 15th 2024

# Post-Quantum Cryptography


Specification repo setup: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pqc
3 instructions
Tampere University prototype is making some forward progress
Working on FPGA mapping

# High Assurance Cryptography 


- Slides presented by Richard: [Wrap-V HAC-TG update 20240208.pdf](https://github.com/riscv-admin/post-quantum-cryptography/files/14225544/Wrap-V.HAC-TG.update.20240208.pdf)
- Barry’s prototype status: RFC8452 SIV-GCM, polyval requires 3 GF multiplies per each stage (GHASH use is not straightforward) https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8452
- Version ID is a must
- What Object ID (OID) should be used ? (existing ones to describe key objects or new ones introduced in the specification, should they be standardized with IETF ?)
- Barry to do a proposal on the encoding of the algorithm part



# Vector Fast Track 

- Draft (v0.0.3) shared on the group mailing list last week: https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-crypto-ext/message/958
- Got a lot of interesting feedback (mostly through the github PR)
    - many Typos to fix
    - discussion on the interaction between the two new extensions, `Zvbc32e`/`Zvkgs`, and Zvkt
    - Interest for `vclmul[h]` on size smaller then 32-bit
- New version (v0.0.4) ready, should be shared on the mailing list this week: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/files/14189035/riscv-crypto-spec-vector-extra_v0.0.4.pdf
- Work can be tracked on pull request: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/362
