# Misc

- Richard, Nicolas, Andrew Dellow (Security HC) and Graeme Hickey (PQShield) were at a panel at RSA conference (Cryptography Track)
- Markku animated a 2-hour tutorial on PQC side-channel at HOST conference
- Usability of RISC-V ISA for CSFC/CNSA (using commercial cryptography to implement hardened cryptography, often through redundancy with different implementation)
- SHA3 has been approved by CNSA for secure boot signature (besides LMS, XMSS)

- Presentation of the security Model during RVIA Tech Chairs meeting (with lengthy discussion on timeline for ratification): https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-security-model (PQC mentionned here https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-security-model/blob/main/specification/src/chapter5.adoc)

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Nothing to report

# High Assurance Cryptography

- Review of Barry's "Three Share Demo Program" document

- the mechanism will require between 5 and 6 operations per AES round (and so will be much slower than unprotected implementation) so 5-6 cycles in an optimized implementation. Pipelining the module would allow as many independent operations to be processed in parallel (assuming the application can expose this level of parallelism)
- vectorizing AES processing may not be feasible if the application does not expose multiple AES streams that can be synchronized without impacting KPI tracked by the user (e.g. latency)
- Need for new random numbers around every 20 clock cycles (need a high-throughput interface to a (T)RNG)
    - Most of the uses are for masking so low quality should be acceptable (except for initialization)
- Question use for SSL/TLS session has key enrollment will have to be followed by clear key clearing by the application. Lifetime of the key may not be enough to justify the enrollment cost (too short connection or long lasting session which will have to be stashed / popped)    

# fast track extensions

- no progress to report (besides ticket update)
