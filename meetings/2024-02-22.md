# Misc

[fixed] New issue raised on the github
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/383 => fixed and merged
Cleaning ratified vector crypto
[Feb 22nd 2024 update] Barna looking at gaps and checking to find required resources 
[carry-over] Discussion on a few issues raised on vector cryptography spec:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/381
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/380 `vfslide1(up/down).vf`
Does not need to be constant time and is floating-point specific
Follow-up discussion required on the ticket
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/issues/379 => fix merged

Next meeting February 29th 2024

# fast track extensions

Tracking: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/pull/362

- Draft v0.0.4 still needs to be shared with the tech-crypto-ext mailing list
- Goal is to share the new spec draft with a broader RVIA audience by the end of February 2024

- Questioning the addition of smaller (8-bit, 16-bit) vector carry-less multiply instructions
     - area / power impact expected ?
     - use cases ?
     - use for some PQC 4th round candidate ? (Markku could you add algorithm names here ?)
     - exhibit more parallel carry-less multiply

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

PQC specification repository: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pqc

- Setup docker flow for PQC spec
- started branch with 2-page document draft: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pqc/tree/dev-doc
    - 3 instructions considered so far
- working on NTT prototype using spike
- Target is to get something working before Real World Crypto


# High Assurance Cryptography 


High Assurance Cryptography specification repository: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-hac

- Some updates on the Wrap-V diagram (including some mistake pointed out by Barry on key #2 and SIV)
- Encouraging everyone to comment on what should be integrated into AEAD (additional data) (see Richard's list in slide: https://github.com/riscv-admin/post-quantum-cryptography/files/14225544/Wrap-V.HAC-TG.update.20240208.pdf) [Spec will list required/reserved/optional fields]
- Next step: defining actual instructions (both for key wrapping and full round AES)
     - will start from original full-round instruction (but will need change to incorporate key handle/wrapper)

- Barry's presentation on the HAC reference design he is designing with Richard: OID's
    - see slides at the end of minutes 
- OID proposal may be part of the HCA specification and should allow future growth

OID's for PQC algorithms: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md
