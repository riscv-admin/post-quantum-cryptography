- timing attack based on shared resource (in this case: write-port resources in execution pipeline)
- Not seen as a critical issue, uarch related (not ISA related)
- RISC-V Security Response Team 

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Markku was not able to join (busy at PQCrypto)

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- no progress to report on the arch
- Barry looked at GHASH implementation compromise (size of carry-less multiplier versus operation latency)
    - figure of merit (gate count * number of cycles required to compute / 1000) to compare the implementations

- Wrap-V requires a lot of random numbers (in a bursty way)
- Wrap-V requires 16 GHASH operations
- Expected performance for HCA:
    - AES is between 96 and 420 cycles for AES-128 and 144 and 924 cycles for AES-256 (very large slowdown compared to single-round implementation)
    - GHASH/SIV: 16 GMUL for a total of about 64 cycles

# fast track extensions

- no progress to report
