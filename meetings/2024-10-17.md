    - Member Day Session: High Assurance Cryptography ISE - G. Richard Newell, Microchip Technology Inc. [October 21st, 4pm, Grand  Ballroom H (level 1)]
    - Development of the First Open-Source Implementation of the RISC-V Vector Cryptography Extension - Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen, Tampere University (https://sched.co/1nCJ1) [Tuesday October 22nd 3:15pm - 3:33pm, Grand Ballroom H (level 1)]
   -  Making the Case for a Keccak Instruction - Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen, Tampere University https://sched.co/1iYv8 [Wednesday October 23rd 2:35pm - 2:53pm, Theater (Level 2)]

-  Industry news: http://cjc.ict.ac.cn/online/onlinepaper/wc-202458160402.pdf (D-wave factorization on a quantum computer) https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-crypto-ext/topic/109011415

- Markku presented his slideset on Marian (Open-Source CPU implementation implement RVV + vector crypto) and his second slideset "Making the case for a Keccak instruction"
- Caliptra 2.0 will have Dilithium support https://github.com/chipsalliance/Caliptra

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- Besides the Keccak instruction a good vrgather would be quite useful for NTT

# High Assurance Cryptography 


# fast track extensions

- Finished experimentation, extra silicon cost of support 8/16, and 32-bit would be less than 20%
- Ready to submit new version of fast track extension to ARC
