 [carry over] Some clean-up is still required for vector crypto (listed in the vector crypto ratification plan spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Trwd7mr91iKlOi7cVlmJaoulw1ZGAAYR8ER7-pRufyI/edit?usp=sharing). (Richard will send an email)


Next meeting Jan 11th 2024

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- The US government is recommending the use of PQC and Hash-based signature.
- NIST-PQC workshop deadline Jan 26th. Markku would like to present his cycle count numbers for Keccak.
- Presentation by Markku of his BSI slides (not public/published yet)
    - Cases for Keccak instruction (large speedup expected)

# High Assurance Cryptography

- Wrap-V wrapping scheme
- Not considering AES-192
- Markku is working on a demonstrator with Tampere eng. School (using CVA6 + ARA vector extension + vector crypto and prototype for PQC acceleration) The goal is to expose cryptographic capabilities through OpenSSL provider.

# Vector Fast Track
