# Misc

- https://github.com/rvkrypto/rvk-misc

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

- further optimizations: NTT from 1500 to 900 instructions (still LMUL=1)
- extended bench to dilithium and Sampler
- Keccak consumes 80% of the time (with RVV 1.0 and ratified vector crypto): this is a good justification to add keccak instruction
- other on-going effort (with K230 bench) to optimize Kyber/Dilithium, should be published soon 

# High Assurance Cryptography 

- discussion around parallel implementation of GHASH
- Discussion on using Ascon (cont. from last week) for RNG generation from seed
- Barry looking for reference on Raccoon: https://raccoonfamily.org/ and https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/pqc-dig-sig/round-1-additional-signatures
- Implementing safeguard to prevent use of initialized random number generator (to ensure RNG quality)
