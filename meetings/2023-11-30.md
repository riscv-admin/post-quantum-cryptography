# Misc

- Some clean-up is still required for vector crypto (listed in the vector crypto ratification plan spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Trwd7mr91iKlOi7cVlmJaoulw1ZGAAYR8ER7-pRufyI/edit?usp=sharing).
- New meeting invite has been setup by Markku
- Meeting time will certainly change (depending on Security HC recommendation and schedule)


# High Assurance

- Task group has been formally accepted with Richard as chair and Markku as vice-chair.
- Presentation done at the summit (Member day)


- Goal is to implement AES and GCM
- Steering towards all round implementations
    - Allowing counter measure (e.g. DPA safe implementation)
- need to look at AES-XTS (using both forward and reverse AES)

# Post Quantum Cryptography

- Discussion on Keccak state size and in particular impact on VLEN=128 implementation:

If we need instructions that manipulates the full 1600-bit Keccak state, this may put a lot of constraint on implementation with "smaller" VLEN (e.g. 128) which are legal implementations in most RISC-V profiles which mandate support for the V extension

To be continued when Markku is back.

# Vector crypto fast track

Kickoff of fast track effort has been accepted by the ARC (https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-arch-review/message/186). The next step is for RVIA to setup the official resources so work can start.
