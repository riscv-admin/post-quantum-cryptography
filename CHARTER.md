# Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Task Group Charter

The Post-Quantum Cryptography Task Group (PQC TG) will explore, recommend, and develop RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Extensions that enhance performance and implementation efficiency for contemporary public-key cryptography, with a focus on standard Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms: Kyber (FIPS 203), Dilithium (FIPS 204), and others. The ISA design and evaluation prioritize the requirements of real-world networked devices, ensuring that the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) extensions effectively complement existing scalar and vector cryptography extensions.

To achieve its goals, the PQC TG, will direct line report to the Unprivileged ISA Committee and dotted line to the Security Horizontal Committee.
