# Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Task Group Charter

The  Post-Quantum Cryptography Task Group (PQC TG) will explore and recommend RISC-V Instruction Set 
Architecture (ISA) Extensions that enhance performance and implementation efficiency for contemporary 
public-key cryptography, with a focus on standard Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms like Kyber, 
Dilithium, and others. The ISA design and evaluation prioritize the requirements of real-world 
networked devices, ensuring that the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) extensions effectively 
complement existing scalar and vector cryptography extensions.

To achieve its goals, the PQC TG, will interact with under the guidance of the Unprivileged 
ISA Committee and the Security Horizontal Committee.
